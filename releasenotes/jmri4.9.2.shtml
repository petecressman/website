      Release Notes for JMRI 4.9.2 release
      </h1>

    <p>Date: mmm dd, 2017</p>
    <p>From: (pumpkin)</p>
    <p>Subject: Test Release 4.9.2 of JMRI/DecoderPro is available for download.</p>

<p><b>This is a draft release note only; the download links do not yet work</b></p>

<h2>Notes:</h2>

<p>This is a test release.  Please post a note if you encounter any new or old bugs!
And please back up your JMRI files before installing this, in case you want to go
back to an earlier version.</p>

<p>This is the first in a series of test releases.
We expect this series to end in the next JMRI production release around the end of 2017.
(See the <a href="https://github.com/JMRI/JMRI/milestones?direction=asc&sort=due_date&state=open"><em>tentative</em> release schedule</a>)
</p>

<p>Some of the changes involved are quite extensive.
They may require a certain amount of experience before they are working well.
Therefore, this test release should be considered experimental.</p>

<h3>Required Migration Step<span class="since">Since <a href="jmri4.7.4.shtml">JMRI 4.7.4</a></span></h3>
JMRI was updated in JMRI 4.7.4 to use a new serial library. Depending on your exact
circumstances, you may need to do some migrations:
<ul>
<li>If you are using JMRI on Linux or Mac OS X and are updating from an older JMRI version,
<em>you must open the JMRI preferences and make sure that the selections are 
correct for your serial device(s).</em> Be sure to save the changes.
<p>
In general, previous versions used serial device names like 
"/dev/cu.usbserial-ABC123FG". This version will generally omit the prefix, and
use serial device names like "cu.usbserial-ABC123FG".
(If given the choice if a name starting with "tty" and one starting with "cu", 
pick the "cu" one). See the before and after images to the right.
<li>
If you are using Linux and have previously used the "JMRI_SERIAL_PORTS"
option to make sure your serial device is visible to JMRI, you'll have 
to change that to use the "purejavacomm.portnamepattern" option instead.
See the 
<a href="http://jmri.org/install/FAQLinux.shtml#usb">JMRI Linux install page</a> for more information.
<li>
If you have your own JMRI scripts to access a serial device, you'll have to update
their library references:
    <ul>
    <li>Any 
        <code>import gnu.io</code> statements will have to be replaced by 
        <code>import purejavacomm</code> statements.
    <li>More generally, any reference to 
        <code>gnu.io</code>, e.g. a reference to a class like 
        <code>gnu.io.SerialPort</code>, statements will have to be replaced by 
        a reference to the corresponding 
        <code>purejavacomm</code> class.
    </ul>
</ul>


<a id="problems" name="problems"></a>
<h3>Known problems with this release</h3>
<ul>
    <li>None</li>
</ul>
<!--
If any of those affect you, please either 
wait for
<a href="jmri4.7.6.shtml">JMRI 4.7.6</a>, due out shortly after this one,
or (once there's a fix for the problem) pick up a
<a href="http://jmri.tagadab.com/jenkins/job/Development/job/Packages/">development build installer</a>
from
<a href="http://jmri.tagadab.com/jenkins/job/Development/job/Packages/">Jenkins</a>.</p>

<a id="warnings" name="warnings"></a>
<h3>New warnings for this release:</h3>

<ul>
    <li></li>
</ul>

<h3>Older warnings</h3>

See the <a href="jmri4.8.shtml#warnings">JMRI 4.8 release note</a> for more warnings predating the 4.8 development series.
These may be relevant to you if you're updating from an earlier version.

<p><span class="since">Since <a href="jmri4.7.5.shtml">JMRI 4.7.5</a></span>
    This version of JMRI (and all later) writes a slightly streamlined
    version of panel file contents.  
    Older files should still be readable by this version of JMRI, 
    but files written by this version may not be readable by versions
    before JMRI 4.2 depending on their contents.

<p><span class="since">Since <a href="jmri4.7.5.shtml">JMRI 4.7.5</a></span>
    The LocoNetOverTCP server has changes that may break scripts that reference it. Scripts refering to
    the class jmri.jmrix.loconet.loconetovertcp.Server need to refer instead to
    jmri.jmrix.loconet.loconetovertcp.LnTcpServer.

<p><span class="since">Since <a href="jmri4.7.3.shtml">JMRI 4.7.3</a></span> 
    This release will not start cleanly if installed over earlier versions of JMRI (the Windows installer ensures
    this is not an issue). Remove the JAR files <em>jackson-annotations-2.0.6.jar</em>, <em>jackson-core-2.0.6.jar</em>,
    and <em>jackson-databind-2.0.6.jar</em> from the <em>lib</em> directory within the previous installation directory to resolve
    this.

<p><span class="since">Since <a href="jmri4.7.1.shtml">JMRI 4.7.1</a></span> JMRI no longer supports the portable paths <code>resource:</code> or <code>file:</code> that
        were deprecated in JMRI 2.13. When loading a panel, an error message will be displayed
        if the panel contains a path that starts with <code>resource:</code> and the panel will
        not load until changed using an external editor. Paths starting with <code>file:</code>
        cannot be automatically flagged because JMRI allows file: URLs.
        
<p><span class="since">Since <a href="jmri4.7.1.shtml">JMRI 4.7.1</a></span>
        The LocoNet Server (the LocoNetRMI service; not the LocoNetOverTcp service)
        in this version of JMRI doesn't properly interoperate with 
        <a href="jmri4.7.1.shtml">JMRI 4.7.1</a> through <a href="jmri4.7.4.shtml">JMRI 4.7.4</a>.
        It does work fine with <a href="jmri4.6.shtml">JMRI version 4.6</a> or before.
        If you encounter a problem with version compatibility, you'll see an error
        message that includes "<code>local class incompatible</code>".
        The workaround is to update both client and server JMRI machines to the same
        JMRI version. 
        
<p><span class="since">Since <a href="jmri4.7.1.shtml">JMRI 4.7.1</a></span> JMRI applications will not load a panel file that fails XML validation; an error will be
        shown that should explains the error, allowing it to be fixed using an editor. (The
	    explanations remain a work in progress.)

<p><span class="since">Since <a href="jmri4.5.6.shtml">JMRI 4.5.6</a></span>  
        As part of fixing the 
        <a href="https://github.com/JMRI/JMRI/issues/2081">TMCC throttle issue</a>,
        the handling of TMCC preferences was changed.  If you have a TMCC
        connection configured, please go to the 
        "<a href="http://jmri.org/help/en/package/apps/TabbedPreferences.shtml#Connection">Defaults</a>"
        pane in the Preferences window and make sure that the 
        TMCC connection is selected for the appropriate device types.

<p><span class="since">Since <a href="jmri4.5.2.shtml">JMRI 4.5.2</a></span> This and future releases of JMRI may not function on OS X if the Java SE 6 provided by Apple is installed. OS X
    operating system updates routinely remove this version of Java SE 6. Please raise any issues concerning this on the
    user's group.
    To remove Java SE 6 from OS X, follow these steps (these steps assume
      JMRI is installed in the folder <em>/Applications/JMRI</em>, if not,
      adjust the following paths as needed):</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Open <em>Terminal.app</em>.
        <p><em>El Capitan only:</em> Reboot into Recovery Mode by restarting your
          Mac and pressing Cmd-R until the Apple logo appears. Once in Recovery Mode,
          select Terminal from the Utilities menu.</p>
        </li>
      <li>Run the command <code>/Applications/JMRI/PanelPro.app/Contents/Resources/uninstall-java6.sh</code> It can take
        up to a half hour to complete. Wait for the message <em>Removed Apple Java SE6</em>.
        <p><em>El Capitan only:</em> Run the command <code>bash /Volumes/Macintosh\ HD/Applications/JMRI/PanelPro.app/Contents/Resources/uninstall-java6.sh /Volumes/Macintosh\ HD</code>
          It can take up to a half hour to complete. Wait for the message <em>Removed Apple Java SE6</em>.</p>
        </li>
      <li><em>El Capitan only:</em> Restart your Mac.</li>
    </ol>
  
<p><span class="since">Since <a href="jmri4.5.2.shtml">JMRI 4.5.2</a></span> Support for directly executing AppleScript within JMRI has been removed
    due to changes in macOS and Java outside our control. If you require the
    ability to use AppleScript, you may be able to add this capability on your
    own by visiting <a href="https://jmri.github.io/applescript">JMRI
      AppleScript Support</a>, but please be aware that this may not work
    on upcoming releases of macOS or Java.

<p><span class="since">Since <a href="jmri4.5.1.shtml">JMRI 4.5.1</a></span> 
    Internal turnouts and sensors need to have complete, individual system names.
    The names "IT" and "IS" (without any suffix) are no longer permitted:
    "IT12" is fine, but just "IT" is not. Most panel files that contain these should
    automatically migrate them to new names when saved, but in some cases you might need to manually update them.

        <h4>C/MRI</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Chuck Catania made multiple updates:
                <ul>
                    <li>Created NodeConfigManager - Opened from the CMRI menu by selecting the Configure Nodes menu item. 
                        Creates a table view of configured nodes for the selected Connection Memo with node UA, node type, 
                        input/output card and bit counts displayed. 
                        Nodes can be added from this window. Nodes are loaded into an Arraylist for function processing. 
                        From the Select column, nodes can be edited and deleted, bit assignments displayed window. 
                        A printed listing of nodes can be done. Only NodeConfigManagerBundle.properties created.

                    <li>The existing NodeConfig tool will be retained during the development cycle and deprecated at the appropriate later time.

                    <li>SerialNode data items added: Text Description, CMRInet Options, Node Options. 
                        Node option "Enable Polling at Startup" which is enabled as default, 
                        provides for selective node polling control when launching PanelPro.

                    <li>Node configuration window format updated with additional data items.

                    <li>Multiple CMRI connection memo added to new and updated classes.

                    <li>ConnectionConfigXml updated to load and store additional node fields. 
                        Backward compatibility is maintained with existing configuration XML files. 
                        Checks for new configuration data fields is implemented. 
                        Loading an existing connection config profile and not doing a Save from the preferences
                        will not update the connection profile with the new data fields.

                    <li>Added support for the MRCS cpNode.
                        A cpNode is defined as node type CPNODE = 3, NDP "C", 8 bit cards, two input cards, two output cards.
                        Input/Output Expander (IOX) card assignment is supported. 
                        cpNode initialize(I) message conforms to NMRA LCS 9.10.1. 
                        Node type 4 is reserved for a future Open Source Node (OSN) offering.

                    <li>Bit Assignment listing function has Comment field added. Assignment listing can be printed.        
                </ul>

   <h3>Warrants</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Help files have been edited to document the following feature additions:</li>
	    <li>When created, warrant throttle command scripts record the track speeds of the recording power address,
	        if a speed profile exists for the power. On playback, when possible, they use 
	        this track speed and look up the corresponding throttle settings rather than the directly recorded 
		throttle setting. The intention is to have the warrant run at the same speeds regardless of changes 
		in DCC address or size of the train load.
		<br>See the "Automatic Speed Profiling" section of the "When Warrant Speeds Are Modified" help
		file for warrants</li>
	    <li>Warrants compute the track speeds for the DCC address on playback of the warrant when OPath lengths
	        are known and throttle settings are known. These are saved in Session Speed Profiles.</li>
	    <li>Session Speed Profiles are kept for all DCC addresses running in warrants during a layout session.</li>
	    <li>Session Speed Profiles can be merged into Roster Speed Profiles when layout sessions end.</li>
	    <li>Warrant Preferences provides three choices for how to handle speed profile merging at shutdown.</li>
	    <li>Speed profiles are viewable when creating or editing warrants or nxwarrants.</li>
	    <li>Speed profiles are checked to be monotonic increasing, and when not, an editing facility is provided.</li>
	    <li>The NXWarrant GUi is split into two successive windows: selecting the route and setting the run parameters</li>
